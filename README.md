# learningcpp
Test files made while learning.

Now its time to write down here what the hell are these files for future me.

# CListBox
A project for understanding how MFC is working. Some operations and etc. That was needed for making UI && coding the program at work. Basic understanding.

# API.cpp && API.h
Its a simple MOEX API tryout. Made for understading how are APIs working on C++. It will be used in future massive project.

# TemplateBubble.cpp
Just a selfmade bubble sorting with templates using in C++. Needed for better understanding possibilities of templates.

# Zadachnik.cpp
Very simple tasks, which were found in net or while reading "wise" books

# mem_sru.cpp
It is an answer to fun question to write own memcpy, which will be as good as original.
